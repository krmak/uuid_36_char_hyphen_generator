# uuid_36_char_hyphen_generator

For this personal Python coding project, I assembled a module that creates a random lowercase 36-character Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID), where alphanumeric portions of the identifier are delimited by four hyphens. 
This project also includes a processor script that imports and invokes the module's random UUID generating function, and prints out the UUID to the console.
